title: Alex Kent's Blog
---

Hello, I'm Alex Kent. The goal for this blog is to be a hub for my personal projects and ideas. I'm hoping it will inspire me to get some more of my projects over the line and serve as a useful reference.

# Who am I?
I started working as a Software Engineer in 2011 after completing my Master's degree in Maths at Durham University in England. At Durham I also studied Go/Weiqi/Baduk which remains a big part of my life.

I currently live in Hong Kong where I mainly deal with C++ & Python professionally.
